### Problems Encountered and Solutions

**Problem**: Existing PNG image needed integration instead of creating new SVG

**Problem**: Local fonts (Geist) were being used instead of project specifications
**Solution**: Removed local font imports, added Google Fonts (Inter/Crimson Pro) via CSS

**Problem**: Build warning about module type for tailwind.config.ts
**Solution**: Warning noted but doesn't affect functionality; can be resolved by adding "type": "module" to package.json if needed

### Dependencies and Configuration

- ✅ Updated `tailwind.config.ts` with custom color palette and fonts

- ✅ Development server testing (`npm run dev`)
- ✅ All components render correctly
- ✅ Images load properly
- ✅ Links function as expected

### Lessons Learned

**Project Structure**: Well-organized component architecture makes updates straightforward
**Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component handles PNG files excellently with proper sizing
**Font Strategy**: Google Fonts integration via CSS is cleaner than local font files for this use case
**Tailwind Customization**: Custom color palette in config makes consistent styling effortless

### Tips for Future Developers

**Development**:
- Use `npm run dev` for local development (runs on port 3500)
- `npm run build` for production builds
- Image files should be placed in `public/images/` directory
- Custom colors are defined in `tailwind.config.ts`

**Deployment**:
- Site is configured for static export
- All assets are optimized for CDN delivery
- Metadata is properly configured for SEO
- Images use Next.js optimization

**Maintenance**:
- Contact information can be updated in `src/components/ContactLinks.tsx`
- Color scheme changes should be made in `tailwind.config.ts`
- Content updates primarily affect `src/app/page.tsx`
- New images should be added to `public/images/` directory

**Architecture**:
- Components are in `src/components/` directory
- Global styles in `src/app/globals.css`
- Page content in `src/app/page.tsx`
- Layout and metadata in `src/app/layout.tsx`

### Final Status
